                    Born in London's East End to Turkish-Cypriot parents, Aysen draws both inspiration and energy from her native city. Aysen studied Fashion with textiles at Ravensbourne and specialised in knitwear. She subsequently went on to work for London-based Ally Capellino and then relocated to Amsterdam to design the Men's knitwear for Tommy Hilfiger. In 2012 Aysen launched Knitster LDN as a bespoke knitwear sampling facility and later established UK-made cult knitwear label FANCLUB to rave reviews. FANCLUB'S 'premium kitsch' aesthetic was synonymous with tongue-in cheek humour and was an ode to Aysen's thought-provoking design and flair for pattern. A true appreciation of craftmanship coupled with an instinctive eye for colour characterises Aysen's work.

                    Dublin-born Emma knows fashion, and thankfully she put her taste for a la mode to good use. It was watching her mother craft traditional Aran sweaters that piqued an early interest in the artistry of textiles and lead to a career in knitwear design. Emma studied fashion design at the National College of Art and Design in Dublin and at NABA in Milan. On graduation in 2004 she moved to London and after various internships at houses such as Roland Mouret and Eley Kishimoto she went on to work for Marks & Spencer for 8 years as an in-house knitwear designer. After a period travelling the world satisfying an innate thirst for adventurous sights Emma met fellow knitwear enthusiast Aysen and together they proudly relaunched Knitster LDN as a boutique swatch house and knitwear design consultancy, with a dedicated sampling facility. The rest as they say, is knitstoryâ€¦
